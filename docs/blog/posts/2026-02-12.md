# :simple-mysql: SQL Stored Procedures


__Stored Procedures__ is a custom piece of code that is stored in the database along with the actual data. This procedue/function can be called and perform calculations, return results or cause other effects to the data stored in the DB.

### :material-hand-front-left-outline: Disclaimer 
- This deep dive only touches the tip of the iceberg of stored procedures. For further and deep documentation, please review [Microsoft Create a Stored Procedure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/stored-procedures/create-a-stored-procedure?view=sql-server-ver17).


### PROs
- Unlike code that exists outside the DBs, a stored procedure can live in the same location where the dat is (in the database) and therefore can work with the data directly. This is often much faster than transferring data back and forth.

### CONs
- Stored procedures add processing load to the database.

### SPROC Job V1 (Basic)
```
# choose a specific table
USE parks_and_recreation

# initiate stored procedure which stores to table
# the semi-colon (;) ends the line 
CREATE PROCEDURE large_salaries()
SELECT *
FROM employee_salary
WHERE salary >= 50000;

# call does the output
CALL large_salaries();
```

### SPROC Job V2 (Custom Delimiter)
```
# choose a specific table
USE parks_and_recreation

DELIMITER $$
# initiate stored procedure which stores to table
# the semi-colon (;) ends the line 
CREATE PROCEDURE large_salaries2()
BEGIN
    SELECT *
    FROM employee_salary
    WHERE salary >= 50000;
    SELECT *
    FROM employee_salary
    WHERE salary >= 10000;
END $$

# need to switch it back otherwise gonna have to keep using $$
DELIMITER ;

# call does the output
CALL large_salaries2();
```

### SPROC Job V3 (Function)
```
# choose a specific table
USE parks_and_recreation

DELIMITER $$

CREATE PROCEDURE large_salaries4(employee_id_param INT)
BEGIN
    SELECT salary
    FROM employee_salary
    WHERE employee_id = employee_id_param
    ;
END $$

DELIMITER ;

CALL large_salaries4(1);
```

### NOTES
- Important to consider that there are likely going to be other things that need to be added to the SPROC job like failure handling, removing SPROC job that exists, etc...
