_"A day without ( :thinking: learning | laughter :laughing: ) is a lost day"_

## Background

Passionate DEV with a strong interest in holistic software development, aiming to become a well-rounded DEV who can contribute across every stage of the development process.

## Purpose

The aim for this mkdoc is to document my journey toward becoming a better SWE by exploring programming concepts, best practices, tools, and real-world problem-solving techniques. Through tutorials, reflections, and practical examples, everything documented aims to provide both a learning resource for others and a personal space to track growth, experiment with new technologies, and refine development skills. This is intended as a guide for anyone interested software development
